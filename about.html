            <h3>Why Mountain Communities Matter</h3>
            <p>
                Mountain communities are home to some of the most diverse ecosystems and cultures on the planet. They play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity, water resources, and cultural heritage. However, these communities often face challenges such as isolation, economic hardship, and environmental threats.
